 
Introduction (Prices below the break):
 
 
 <br>
<br>

Hello! I am a freelancer artist, who specializes in erotic and safe-for-work rated art involving anthropomorphic characters, but I have experience in drawing from life as well. I offer everything from sketches to realistic paintings with a wide variety of styles.
 <br>

I believe that customer satisfaction is the best advertisement one can hope to strive for.
 <br>

Drawing helps me put food on the table and pay my bills.
 <br>

I also have a Fanbox if you'd like to support my art and receive more original content created by me and gain some rewards:<br>

 <br>

I am also very open about any subject material.

and thanks for the interest you have taken in my work!
 <br>
I will draw almost any fetish and character, feel free to ask.

You will get a large resolution, lossless image without watermarks (usually I start sketching on around 4000 x 4000 pixels, but it can vary depending on the image, itâ€™s only a rough guideline), and the PSD file too if you prefer.
 <br>
Here are my PRICES / 1 CHARACTER in USD (mostly NSFW examples, viewer discretion is advised), preferred payment is through PayPal:

If you have any questions, feel free to ask me about it!
